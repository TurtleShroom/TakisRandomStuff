Right now you can only grind to the base herbs. I really don't were to go from Here. What i am thinking is mixing and matching the base herbs for medicine that when not used for tending has some kind of bonus with reduced risk of addiction.

Tell right now all herbs are made from medicine and only sooth pain.

Planned.
