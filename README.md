https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1672676409

- Replaced the bundled Universal Fermenter with the Universal Fermenter-mod prerequirement

- Removed the unmentioned stack-increase since this can be better achieved with mods like https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=826366050]Stack XXL for example
- Renamed the fermenting pots def since it overwrote the UF-definiton
